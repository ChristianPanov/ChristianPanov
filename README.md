### Hello everyone, I'm Chris ðŸ‘‹

Iâ€™m currently working on lwlog - a very fast logging library. Feel free to check it out and don't be afraid to contribute and to post issues, I encourage you

I am interested in crafting library solutions in C++ and graphics programming.
Future projects of mine include a 2D rendering solution for developing 2D interfaces and a 3D game engine. And probably a couple of smaller projects between them.

I value open-source because such projects are not just products people can use for free, they also bare a responsibility - to be resources other people can learn from.
